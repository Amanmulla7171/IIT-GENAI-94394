aman,0fecf0e4-3a60-408d-b075-5cf17e5d82f6,user,give the information about the how we add option of add files at the time creating a chatbot using streamlit give the code for that
aman,0fecf0e4-3a60-408d-b075-5cf17e5d82f6,assistant,"To add the option to upload files while creating a chatbot using Streamlit, you can utilize the `st.file_uploader` function provided by the Streamlit library. Here's an example of how you can integrate this feature into your chatbot:

### Prerequisites
- Install Streamlit by running `pip install streamlit` in your terminal.
- Ensure you have a basic understanding of Python and Streamlit.

### Code Example

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# Function to handle uploaded files
def handle_uploaded_file(uploaded_file):
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        # Display uploaded file details
        st.write(""Uploaded File Details:"")
        st.write(f""Filename: {uploaded_file.name}"")
        st.write(f""Type: {uploaded_file.type}"")
        st.write(f""Size: {uploaded_file.size} bytes"")
        
        # For example, if you're uploading an image or a CSV file
        if uploaded_file.type == ""text/csv"":
            df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
            st.write(""CSV Data:"")
            st.write(df)
        elif uploaded_file.type.startswith(""image/""):
            st.image(uploaded_file)
        else:
            # Handle other types of files as needed
            st.write(""File contents:"")
            st.write(uploaded_file.read().decode(""utf-8""))

# Creating the chatbot interface with a file upload option
st.title(""Chatbot with File Upload"")
st.subheader(""Upload your file here:"")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader(""Choose a file"", type=[""csv"", ""pdf"", ""txt"", ""jpg"", ""png""])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    handle_uploaded_file(uploaded_file)

# Adding a simple chat interface
st.subheader(""Chat:"")
user_input = st.text_input(""You:"", placeholder=""Type your message here..."")
if st.button(""Send""):
    st.write(f""You: {user_input}"")
    # Basic chatbot response
    response = ""I received your message: "" + user_input
    st.write(f""Bot: {response}"")
```

### Explanation

- **File Uploader**: The `st.file_uploader` function is used to add a file upload widget to your Streamlit app. You can specify the types of files that can be uploaded.
- **File Handling Function**: The `handle_uploaded_file` function is a placeholder for how you might want to handle the uploaded file. It currently displays the file's details and previews its contents for images, CSV, and text files.
- **Chat Interface**: A basic text input and send button are implemented to create a simple chat interface. The chatbot's response is directly based on the user's input for demonstration purposes.
- **Running the App**: After writing your code, run it with `streamlit run your_script.py`, replacing `your_script.py` with the name of your Python file.

This example provides a foundation. Depending on your specific needs, you can customize the file handling logic and chatbot responses further."
